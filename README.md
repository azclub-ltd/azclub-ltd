### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my profile
-------------------------

I am Shahriar Kabir. I am a student as well as teenager. I love coding. Being a modern world architect is my dream since I was 13. I always go through detailed learning and hate shortcut. Hence a lot of library and things already built but I like to see the working mechanism behind them. I didn't work for any company or organization. I usually learn programming stuff from internet and free courses.

I know 
- HTML
- CSS
- Basic JavaScript (noob)
- php (intermediate)
- MySQL (use cheat sheet to remember)
- Java for android dev
- bash scripting

I am currently working on some android project. I also have some other repositories you can check it if you wish to do..

I am looking for help to create some mobile IDE to make coding available to all.

You can't connect me on social media platform. Only way you can contact me via [Email](mailto:sksagor@duck.com?subject=came%20from%20github). 

Fun fact: I learn and code on mobile.

I will be inactive till Dec 2022 for exam. See you after that.
